## Challenge 1 : Data Preprocessing
In this first exercise, we will cover the preliminary steps necessary to all kind of statistical modeling.

- Open the Anaconda Prompt, and navigate to this exercise folder:
```bash
cd # Gets back to the $HOME directory
cd Documents/GitHub/ml-week-challenges/03-Best-Practices/01-Data-Preprocessing
```

- Once you are located in the proper folder, run the following command:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

To get started, open the `01-Data-Preprocessing.ipynb` notebook.
