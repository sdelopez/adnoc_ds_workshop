## Challenge 4 : Grid Search

Grid Searching is the process of testing different parameter values for a model and selecting the ones that produce the best results. 

In this exercice, you will:
- Load data
- Make a parameter dictionary
- Initiate a GridSearch algorithm
- GridSearch your data
- Print the results

---

- Open the Anaconda Prompt, and navigate to this exercise folder:
```bash
cd # Gets back to the $HOME directory
cd Documents/GitHub/ml-week-challenges/03-Best-Practices/04-GridSearch
```

- Once you are located in the proper folder, run the following command:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

To get started, open the `04-GridSearch.ipynb` notebook and follow the instructions !
