## Challenge 1 : Linear Regression
In this first exercice, we will create **linear regression** models and emphasize how to use **sklearn** to do so. The dataset used is purposely small - we will have a look at bigger datasets in the next challenges.

We will start with a simple modeling of two data points and then focus on the practical steps needed to apply them to more complicated situations.


- Open the Anaconda Prompt, and navigate to this exercise folder:
```bash
cd # Gets back to the $HOME directory
cd Documents/GitHub/ml-week-challenges/02-Supervised-Learning/01-Linear-Regression
```

- Once you are located in the proper folder, run the following command:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Click on the `01-Linear-Regression.ipynb` file to open the notebook and follow the steps !

:bulb: Don't forget to **push your code to GitHub** once you are done !

1. Open GitHub Desktop
1. It should automatically detect that the `01-Linear-Regression.ipynb` file has changed. If not, ask a TA
1. Make sure this file is ticked, and write a _commit message_ in the bottom left form (For instance: `work on Linear Regression`)
1. Click on the "Commit to `master`" button at the bottom of the form
1. Click on the "Push `origin`" button at the top of the window
