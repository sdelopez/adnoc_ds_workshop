# Setup

During this week, we will use the following tools:

- **Anaconda**, a Python distribution including **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Google Chrome** to search the [Python doc](https://docs.python.org/3/), Google and [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/tour)
- A GitHub account. If you have one, use it, if you don't, [create one](https://github.com/join) (it's free).
- **GitHub Desktop**, a tool to collaborate and archive code

These tools should _already_ be installed on your computer, if not, you can follow the manual setup.

:warning: Don't skip the "Getting ready for the challenges" section though!

## Setup

### Anaconda

Head over to [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) and **download** the latest release for **Python 3.7+**. The website should _automatically_ detect your Operating System (Windows, Mac or Linux). By default you will download the _Graphical Installer_ which is the easiest one.

Once the download is finished, **launch the installer** and go through the wizard. When all is done, check that it's working by launching the **Anaconda Navigator**. It should look like this:

### GitHub Desktop

Head over to [`desktop.github.com`](https://desktop.github.com/) to download it. Launch it, and log in with your GitHub account. This is what you should see:

## Getting ready for the challenges

Let's [**clone**](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository) the exercise repository to your computer. The easier way of doing that (i.e. avoiding the command line) is to use **GitHub Desktop**. Launch it, log in, and clone the `<user.github_nickname>/ml-week-challenges` repository.

Make sure you know **where** the clone happened, meaning you can find the folder on your computer. We will need that later on when it comes to open an exercise boilerplate and solve the challenge. By default, GitHub Desktop on Windows will clone the repository to your `C:\Users\$YOUR_USERNAME\Documents\GitHub\ml-week-challenges`.

Not sure? Ask a TA!

Ready? :point_right: Let's start the first exercise, **Notebook 101**.
