# Challenge 1 : Notebook 101
- Now that you have cloned the `ml-week-challenges` repository locally, you can navigate to the corresponding directory on your local machine. Open the Anaconda Prompt, and navigate to this exercise folder:
```bash
cd # Gets back to the $HOME directory
cd Documents/GitHub/ml-week-challenges/01-Data-Science-Toolkit/01-Notebook-101
```

- Once you are located in the proper folder, run the following command:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

After a few seconds, your default browser should open a new tab and display the Jupyter interface, listing the files in your current folder. If it does not, look at the terminal, it should say something along those lines:

```
The Jupyter Notebook is running at:
[I ..... NotebookApp] http://localhost:8888/?token=.....
```

You can then copy/paste this URL into a new tab of your browser.

You can then click on the `01-Notebook-101.ipynb` file to open the Notebook for this challenge. While you are working, do not close the terminal tab running `jupyter notebook`, or don't `Ctrl`-`C`, otherwise it will quit and you won't be able to work anymore!
